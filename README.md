# isoWATFLOOD
This code is developed to run with the hydrologic portion of the WATFLOOD mode, CHARM (Canadian Routing and Hydrologic Model). CHARM is available on GitHub; isoWATFLOOD will not run without CHARM. isoWATFLOOD code is the collaborative effort of Dr. T. Stadnyk and Ms. T. Holmes; developers assume no libability for the code or its output. This code is provided for research purposes. To report issues or for assistance, please contact tricia.stadnyk@ucalgary.ca.
